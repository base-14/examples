  "high_quality": "Kubernetes orchestrates containerized applications across clusters of machines. It automates deployment, scaling, and management of container workloads. The control plane manages the cluster state through components including the API server, scheduler, and controller manager. Worker nodes run pods, the smallest deployable units, each containing one or more containers sharing network and storage resources. Declarative configuration through YAML manifests enables reproducible infrastructure management.",
  "low_quality": "Kubernetes is like super hard to learn but its the best thing ever. Everyone should use it because containers are cool. Docker is also good but kubernetes is better because it does more stuff. Trust me I know because I read about it on reddit.",
  "medium_quality": "Machine learning models can be deployed using various approaches. Some teams prefer batch inference while others use real-time serving. The choice depends on latency requirements and cost constraints. Popular tools include TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, and Triton Inference Server.",
  "technical_precise": "PostgreSQL implements Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) to handle concurrent transactions without read locks. Each transaction sees a snapshot of the database at its start time. Write operations create new tuple versions rather than modifying existing data in place. The VACUUM process reclaims storage occupied by dead tuples that are no longer visible to any active transaction.",
  "creative_engaging": "Imagine debugging a production issue at 3 AM. Your monitoring dashboard lights up like a Christmas tree. The culprit? A single misplaced semicolon in a configuration file deployed six hours ago. This scenario, familiar to every seasoned developer, illustrates why automated configuration validation isn't just nice to have — it's essential infrastructure.",
  "poorly_structured": "So basically what I want to talk about is APIs. APIs are important. REST APIs use HTTP. GraphQL is also a thing. Some people like one and some like the other. There are pros and cons. Also gRPC exists. The end."
