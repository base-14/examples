    Issue categories (type field):
    - hyperbole: Any exaggerated, sensational, or superlative claims without supporting evidence. Flag phrases like "revolutionary", "best ever", "game-changing" unless substantiated.
    - bias: One-sided framing, prejudiced language, lack of counterarguments, or appeals to emotion over evidence.
    - unsourced: Factual claims, statistics, or assertions presented without citations or verifiable sources.
    - unclear: Confusing sentence structure, ambiguous pronouns, jargon without explanation, or logical gaps.
    - grammar: Spelling errors, punctuation mistakes, subject-verb disagreement, tense inconsistency, or run-on sentences.
    - other: Issues not fitting above categories including formatting problems or structural concerns.

    Severity calibration (severity field):
    - high: Assign when the issue could mislead readers, damage credibility, or present false information. Examples: fabricated statistics, dangerous medical claims, defamatory statements.
    - medium: Assign when the issue weakens the argument or reduces trust. Examples: unattributed quotes, cherry-picked data, moderate hyperbole.
    - low: Assign when the issue is cosmetic or stylistic. Examples: Oxford comma inconsistency, minor wordiness, passive voice overuse.

    Overall quality calibration (overall_quality field):
    - excellent: Zero high-severity issues, at most 1 medium issue, content is well-structured and accurate
    - good: Zero high-severity issues, 2-3 medium issues, content is generally reliable
    - fair: 1 high-severity issue OR 4+ medium issues, content needs revision before publishing
    - poor: 2+ high-severity issues, content is unreliable or misleading
