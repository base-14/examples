# OpenTelemetry Collector Configuration for Local Development
#
# Purpose: Receives telemetry from the Spring Boot app and prints to console
# Use case: Local debugging and testing - verify telemetry is being sent correctly
#
# For production: Replace debug/logging exporters with actual backend exporters:
#   - otlp: Forward to base14 Scout
#   - See: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/

receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      # gRPC endpoint (default port 4317)
      grpc:

      # HTTP endpoint (default port 4318) - used by Spring Boot app
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318

processors:
  # Batch processor - groups telemetry for efficient export
  batch:
    timeout: 10s
    send_batch_size: 1024

exporters:
  # Debug exporter - prints detailed telemetry to console
  debug:
    verbosity: detailed
  # Logging exporter - prints summary to console logs
  logging:
    loglevel: info

service:
  pipelines:
    # Traces pipeline - distributed tracing data

    # Metrics pipeline - counters, gauges, histograms
    metrics:

    # Logs pipeline - structured application logs
